# Technical Debt Analysis

## Key Issues
- **Legacy Functions:** Old, unclear functions (e.g., original `calc`) still present in codebase.
- **Inconsistent Input Validation:** Not all functions validate input types or handle errors consistently.
- **Duplicate Logic:** Similar logic for parsing/averaging numbers appears in multiple places.
- **Lack of Automated Tests:** Edge cases and error handling are not fully covered by tests.
- **Documentation Gaps:** Not all functions are documented or have usage examples.

## Risks
- Bugs and regressions due to unclear or duplicated code.
- Security vulnerabilities from missing validation.
- Increased maintenance cost and onboarding time.

## Suggested Actions
- Remove or refactor legacy code.
- Centralize input validation and parsing logic.
- Increase test coverage, especially for edge cases.
- Enforce documentation and code style via linting and PR review.
