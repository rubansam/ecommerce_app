## State Management Strategy

- **Global State (Redux):**
  - Auth/user session
  - Cart contents
  - Product catalog (with pagination/filter state)
  - Orders (list/history)
  - Notifications
  - UI state (global loading, error, modals)

- **Side Effects (Redux-Saga):**
  - API calls (fetch, create, update, delete)
  - Authentication flows (login, logout, register)
  - Cart/order/payment flows
  - Notification polling or push

- **Local State (React Hooks):**
  - Form field values and validation
  - UI component state (open/close, selected tab, etc.)

## API Integration

| Screen/Component      | API Endpoints Used                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Profile               | `GET /users/me`, `PUT /users/me`                                                   |
| Product List          | `GET /products`                                                                    |
| Product Detail        | `GET /products/:id`                                                                |
| Cart                  | `GET /cart`, `POST /cart/items`, `PUT /cart/items/:id`, `DELETE /cart/items/:id`   |
| Checkout              | `POST /orders`                                                                     |
| Order Confirmation    | `GET /orders/:id`                                                                  |
| Orders/Order History  | `GET /orders`                                                                      |

| Admin Dashboard       | `POST /products`, `PUT /products/:id`, `DELETE /products/:id`                      |

## Data Input/Output

- **Forms:**  
  - Use controlled components with validation (client-side and server error display).
  - Show inline errors and helper text.
  - Password fields masked, with show/hide toggle.

- **Data Display:**  
  - Use Material UI tables, lists, and cards for products, orders, notifications.
  - Support pagination and filtering where applicable.

- **User Interactions:**  
  - Optimistic UI updates for cart actions.
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete, logout).
  - Toast/snackbar notifications for success/error feedback.

---

## UI/UX Considerations

- **Responsiveness:**  
  - Mobile-first design, grid/flex layouts, responsive breakpoints.

- **Loading States:**  
  - Show loaders/spinners during async actions and data fetches.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Display user-friendly error messages.
  - Retry options for recoverable errors.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation and focus management.
  - Color contrast and font size meet WCAG 2.1 AA.

- **Optimistic Updates:**  
  - For cart and notification actions, update UI before server confirmation, with rollback on error.

---

## Routing Strategy

- **React Router (v6+):**
  - Use nested routes for dashboard/admin.
  - ProtectedRoute component for authenticated and role-based access.
  - Route-based code splitting for performance.
  - 404 Not Found fallback route.

**Example Route Structure:**
```
/
  |-- /products
  |-- /products/:id
  |-- /cart
  |-- /checkout
  |-- /orders
  |-- /orders/:id
  |-- /profile
  |-- /notifications
  |-- /admin (admin only)
  |-- /login
  |-- /register
  |-- *
```
